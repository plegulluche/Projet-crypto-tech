## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, creating server-side applications with JavaScript.

## Express.js

Express.js is a popular node.js web application framework that provides a range of features to help you create web applications quickly. Some of its features include:
Routing: Express.js provides an easy way to handle routes, which map URLs to functions that handle the request and generate the response.
Middleware: Express.js allows you to use middleware functions, which are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. You can use middleware to perform tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, and serving static files.
Templating: Express.js supports several template engines, which allow you to define the structure of your HTML or other types of content and use placeholders for dynamic data.

## Mongoose

Mongoose is an object-document mapping (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It allows you to define schemas for the documents in your MongoDB collections, and provides an easy way to query and manipulate those documents.
Here is an example of how you might use these technologies to build a simple backend application that stores and retrieves data from a MongoDB database.

## Launch the server

After cloning the repository you will need in order to start the server to do the following instructions :

- Npm I (to install all the necessaries depedencies)
- Npm run start (To start the server)
  And that’s it !!

You‘re backend application is now running
