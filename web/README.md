# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, creating server-side applications with JavaScript.

## Express.js

Express.js is a popular node.js web application framework that provides a range of features to help you create web applications quickly. Some of its features include:
Routing: Express.js provides an easy way to handle routes, which map URLs to functions that handle the request and generate the response.
Middleware: Express.js allows you to use middleware functions, which are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. You can use middleware to perform tasks such as logging, parsing request bodies, and serving static files.
Templating: Express.js supports several template engines, which allow you to define the structure of your HTML or other types of content and use placeholders for dynamic data.

## Mongoose

Mongoose is an object-document mapping (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It allows you to define schemas for the documents in your MongoDB collections, and provides an easy way to query and manipulate those documents.
Here is an example of how you might use these technologies to build a simple backend application that stores and retrieves data from a MongoDB database.

## Launch the server

After cloning the repository you will need in order to start the server to do the following instructions :

- Npm I (to install all the necessaries depedencies)
- Npm run start (To start the server)
  And that’s it !!

You‘re backend application is now running
